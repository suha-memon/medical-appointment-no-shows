# Medical Appointment No-Show Prediction

## Introduction
Medical appointment no-shows are a persistent issue in healthcare, leading to inefficiencies, increased costs, and poorer health outcomes. Our team set out to explore how various factors influence a patient’s likelihood of missing a scheduled medical appointment. Our goal was to build a predictive model that could help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and take proactive measures to reduce no-show rates.

## The Problem: Why No-Shows Matter
Healthcare institutions face significant disruptions when patients miss scheduled appointments. Some key consequences include:
- Wasted resources (unused time slots, inefficient scheduling)
- Delays in patient care (leading to worse health outcomes)
- Financial loss for hospitals and clinics
- Strain on healthcare professionals who must reallocate time and resources

By predicting which patients are likely to miss appointments, providers can intervene — through reminders, incentives, or alternative scheduling — to improve attendance rates and ensure timely medical care.

## Dataset and Exploratory Data Analysis
We worked with a publicly available dataset containing medical appointment records. The dataset included features such as:
- **Patient demographics** (age, gender, neighborhood)
- **Appointment details** (scheduled day, appointment day, lead time)
- **Health factors** (hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, handicap)
- **SMS reminders** (whether a patient received a reminder or not)
- **Previous no-show history**

## Data Preprocessing
Before modeling, we conducted a series of critical data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure our dataset was well-structured and ready for analysis:

### Handling Missing Values
- We analyzed the dataset for missing data and imputed missing values using statistical methods (mean, median) where appropriate.
- Records with excessive missing data were removed.

### Encoding Categorical Variables
- Since machine learning models require numerical input, we converted categorical features (e.g., gender, neighborhood) into numerical representations using one-hot encoding.

### Feature Scaling
- To standardize continuous variables (e.g., age, lead time), we applied min-max scaling, ensuring that all features had comparable ranges and prevented bias towards features with large values.

### Balancing the Dataset
- Since no-show instances were underrepresented in the dataset, we applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to generate synthetic samples, ensuring a balanced class distribution and preventing model bias towards the dominant class.

### Outlier Detection
- We used statistical techniques such as the **IQR (Interquartile Range) method** to identify and remove extreme outliers, ensuring cleaner data for model training.

## Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During exploratory data analysis, we uncovered several significant trends:
- **Younger patients** had a higher no-show rate compared to older adults, possibly due to lifestyle factors or work commitments.
- **Longer wait times** between scheduling and appointment day increased no-show likelihood, indicating that reducing lead time may improve attendance.
- **Receiving an SMS reminder** slightly reduced the likelihood of missing an appointment, suggesting that reminders are somewhat effective but not a guaranteed solution.
- **Certain neighborhoods** had a disproportionately high no-show rate, indicating potential socio-economic barriers affecting appointment adherence.
- **Patients with a history of prior no-shows** were significantly more likely to miss future appointments, making prior no-show behavior a strong predictor.

## Building the Predictive Model
To predict no-shows, we experimented with multiple machine learning models:
- **Logistic Regression**: A simple baseline model providing interpretability.
- **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble method handling non-linearity.
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: A powerful model improving weak learners iteratively.
- **Neural Networks (Deep Learning Approach)**: A complex model capturing non-linear relationships.

## Model Training and Evaluation
We split the dataset into **training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets** to ensure our model could generalize to unseen data. To optimize model performance, we employed **grid search and cross-validation**, fine-tuning hyperparameters to prevent overfitting and improve predictive accuracy.

### Key Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision and Recall**: Evaluates the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
- **F1-Score**: A balanced metric that considers both precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC Score**: Measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes.

## Model Performance
After training and evaluating our models, we found that **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** outperformed other models, achieving the highest accuracy and F1-score. The most influential features in our model were:
- **Previous no-show history** (strongest predictor of future behavior)
- **Appointment lead time** (longer wait times correlated with higher no-show rates)
- **Neighborhood** (some locations had persistently high no-show rates)
- **Age** (younger patients were less likely to attend appointments)

## Impact and Future Work
Our model provides a scalable solution for healthcare providers to predict no-shows and take preemptive actions. Potential future enhancements include:
- **More granular patient history data** (e.g., frequency of past visits, appointment types)
- **Real-time intervention strategies** (e.g., AI-driven personalized reminders based on patient behavior)
- **Integration with hospital scheduling systems** to dynamically reschedule high-risk patients
- **Personalized patient engagement strategies** leveraging behavioral science insights
- **Testing alternative modeling techniques** such as reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust appointment scheduling based on prediction confidence

By leveraging machine learning, hospitals and clinics can move towards more efficient and patient-centered care, reducing appointment gaps, optimizing resource utilization, and improving health outcomes.

## Conclusion
Missed medical appointments are a significant challenge for healthcare systems, leading to wasted resources, delays in patient care, and increased costs. However, data-driven insights can help mitigate this issue. Our project demonstrated how machine learning can be used to predict high-risk patients, providing healthcare institutions with a potential tool to enhance appointment adherence and operational efficiency.
